# St. Peter - ESP8266

This is part of the toy system built for controlling our office's air conditioner units via Slack. This repo contains the ESP sketch, based on the [WifiClient example sketch](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/WiFiClient/WiFiClient.ino), as well as the schematics for the accompanying circuit.
